# About Me

I'm a 19 year old programmer who has been programming for about ~4 years at this point, I started geting into programming when I studied computer science at GCSE level back in secondary school.

I started learning with python 3.5, which initially I disliked - but went on to use a lot. After finishing my GCSES and being 16 I started taking an interest in making games with unity due to its low barrier of entry, some of which are in my repositories.

I then went on to do a year of electronic engineering at BTEC level, which after doing for a year I decided to change courses to computer science as I realised I was much more interested with the concept of creating software than circuitry. I finished the course in 2022 and had learnt quite a lot of different concepts such as client/server, certain cybersecurity techniques, computer networks, HCI, java mobile app development, and more. 

During my course I was also lucky enough to do work experience at a local software company where I got an insight into creating full stack applications, which is what im currently most interested in pursuing.

## Things i've done

I've made **Websites**, **Unity games**, a couple **APIs** and other various projects ranging from small console based applications to a few automation based GUIs such as my video downloader and file sorter done in python with TKinter. Most of the repos on here are from different years throughout my years of programming.
